Due to the nature of Galaxy being a public server, the data processing does run fairly slowly. As such, the raw and intermediate data as well as the results can be copied here in this folder. This allows you to upload the relevant data to Galaxy and continue running your analysis from that step onwards. The files are zipped so you need to unzip it before being able to work with it.

The data is broken up into:
*Raw Data
*Reference Sequences
*Aligned bams using HISAT2
*Quantified transcripts using Cufflinks
*Merged transcripts using Cuffmerge
*Differential expression results from Cuffdiff
