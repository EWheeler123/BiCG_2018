# What does all this mean?!?

## File formats

* GenBank Flat File: file format for genbank intended to be human readable
* Fasta: sequence(s)
* Fastq: sequence(s) with qualities
* Sam/Bam: aligned reads either human readable or not
* VCF: variant file

For definitions of file formats, check [here](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html).

## Databases and what they are used for

[NCBI](http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)  
* many, many resources including literature (PubMed and PMC), health (dbGaP and ClinVar), genomes (WG adn RefSeq), proteins (Seq and 3D structures), and chemicals (PubChem and BioSystems)
* includes Entrez gene, the best way to explore gene information (according to BFFO)  

[ICGC data portal](https://dcc.icgc.org/)  
* provides tools for visualizing, querying and downloading the data released quarterly by the consortium's member projects.
* protected and non-protected data from 90 global cancer projects 
* includes tumor/normal pairs with genome, transcriptome, methylome, and clinical data  
* includes TCGA data

TCGA: The Cancer Genome Atlas

[COSMIC: Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic)  

dbGaP  

EGA  

[Dockstore](http://dockstore.org)  

[UCSC Human Cancer](https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu)  

[GDC: Genomic Data Commons Data Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)  

[Cancer Genome Collaboratory](https://www.cancercollaboratory.org)  

### Gene fusion databases

[ChimerDB 3](http://ercsb.ewha.ac.kr/fusiongene)  
* for browsing gene fusions

TCGA gene fusion



## Genome browsers

Used to explore genomes. Can load "tracks" of extra info. Most common UCSC then EnsEMBL then NCBI Map Viewer. Many others exist.

## Alignment vs Assembly

## CNVs, SNVs, and Fusions

## Pathway and Network Analysis

**can we do a network diagram with inputs, outputs, and flows**
