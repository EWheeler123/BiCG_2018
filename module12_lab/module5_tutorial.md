# Bioinformatics on Big Data Module 5 Lab

This lab was created by Solomon Shorser

## Introduction 

### Description of the lab


Welcome to the lab for Big Data Analysis! This lab will consolidate what you have learned about Cloud Computing by aligning reads from a cell line as an example.

After this lab, you will be able to:

* Install the dockstore CLI.
* Run CWL tools and workflows using the dockstore CLI.

Things to know before you start:

The lab may take between 1-2 hours, depending on your familiarity with Cloud Computing and alignment tasks. 
   
### Requirments

Set up a fresh VM by following the instructions in [Module 3 lab] (https://github.com/bioinformatics-ca/bioinformatics-ca.github.io/blob/master/2016_workshops/collaboratory/mod3/module3_lab.md), but with the following changes:

* choose flavor c1.large
* don't assign a floating IP

Without a floating IP, this VM is only accessible from Collaboratory.  Note that there are often not enough floating IPs for all VMs when you're running a fleet.  So you'll have to set up a "jump server" as a getway to ssh from outside into Collaboratory.  Then from the jump server, you can ssh into any of the VMs in your fleet.  We'll use the VM (c1.micro) you've set up for Modules 3 and 4 as a jump server.  If you haven't already done so, add your prviate key to the jump server.  From the console, find the IP address of the new c1.large VM and ssh into it.

```
ssh -i path_to_private_key ubuntu@10.0.0.XXX
```

## Setting up your VM


### Install Java

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
```

### Get the dockstore tool

```
mkdir -p ~/sbin
cd ~/sbin
sudo apt-get install wget
wget https://github.com/ga4gh/dockstore/releases/download/1.0/dockstore
chmod u+x dockstore
```

### Add the location of the dockstore script to $PATH. 

Using your favourite text editor (try pico if you don't have one), add this line to the end of ~/.bashrc:

```
PATH=$PATH:~/sbin
```

Now, set up the dockstore configuration file:

```
cd ~
mkdir -p ~/.dockstore
touch ~/.dockstore/config
```

#### Add to ~/.dockstore/config these lines:

##### The URL for dockstore

```
server-url: https://dockstore.org:8443
```

##### A token 

You only need a valid token if you want to push data TO dockstore. To pull data, "DUMMY" is fine.

```
token: DUMMY
```

##### Caching

Turn on caching to prevent the same input files from being downloaded again and again and again...

```
use-cache=true
```

### Install docker 

```
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

This will take a few minutes. Detailed installation information can be found [here] (https://docs.docker.com/v1.8/installation/ubuntulinux/)

#### Add your user to the docker user group

This is so you can run `docker` without having to sudo every time.   
After you execute the line below, you will need to **log out and log back in**.   

```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

### Get cwltool

```
sudo apt install python-pip
pip install setuptools==24.0.3
pip install cwl-runner cwltool==1.0.20160712154127 schema-salad==1.14.20160708181155 avro==1.8.1
```

*Note:* If you are on **ubuntu 14**, you may also need `sudo pip install typing` and pip install commands will need to be run as `sudo`: 

```
sudo pip install setuptools==24.0.3 
sudo pip install cwl-runner cwltool==1.0.20160712154127 schema-salad==1.14.20160708181155 avro==1.8.1 
```

### Use the dockstore CLI to fetch the CWL

The dockstore CLI will download the CWL file for the tool specified by `--entry`.

```
dockstore tool cwl --entry quay.io/pancancer/pcawg-bwa-mem-workflow:2.6.8-cwl1 > Dockstore.cwl
```

*Note:* If you get an error "dockstore: command not found", that's because you haven't logged out and logged back in after adding yourself to the docker group.


### Prepare your JSON input file


#### Generate the JSON file

JSON files can be automatically generated from the CWL file. You will have to fill in the default values in this file.

```
dockstore tool convert cwl2json --cwl Dockstore.cwl > Dockstore.json
```

#### Download an existing file

An existing input JSON file can be found here.  Edit it if you wish, but note that '~' if used in the JSON is not interpreted as home directory.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioinformatics-ca/bioinformatics-ca.github.io/master/2016_workshops/collaboratory/module5_lab/sample_input.json
```

### Create a directory for the output data.  We use '~/tmp' in the example JSON.

```
mkdir ~/tmp
```

You are ready to run BWA-Mem using the Dockstore CLI (see below).  However, if you have time, try downloading the input data (unaligned BAM) to your VM using the icgc-storage-client.  In Module 3, you ran icgc-storage-client as a Docker.  We'll now run it as a command line tool.  

### Download unaligned BAMs using the icgc-storage-client

To install the tool,

```
wget -O icgc-storage-client.tar.gz https://dcc.icgc.org/api/v1/ui/software/icgc-storage-client/latest
tar -zxvf icgc-storage-client.tar.gz
```

Here are the 2 unaligned BAMs with their object ids.  They are are open-access in Collaboratory and don't require a token.

```
hg19.chr22.5x.normal.bam	26ed125c-bc28-552c-b82d-1de2561b3911
hg19.chr22.5x.normal2.bam	1039a928-a767-5fe4-a50a-4e7af8ced828
```

One way to download is to genereate a pre-signed URL, and download using curl or wget.  Remember to put quotes for the URL in the wget command.  Otherwise, you'll get a 403 error.

```
mkdir input
icgc-storage-client-1.0.21/bin/icgc-storage-client --profile collab url --object-id 1039a928-a767-5fe4-a50a-4e7af8ced828
wget -O input/hg19.chr22.5x.normal2.bam "<pre-signed URL>"
```

A second way to download is to use the icgc-storage client which will handle multi-part download and resume after interruption.

```
icgc-storage-client-1.0.21/bin/icgc-storage-client --profile collab download --object-id 26ed125c-bc28-552c-b82d-1de2561b3911 --output-layout bundle --output-dir input
```

You may want to organize the files in your input directory. Then edit the JSON sample_input.json to update under "reads" the paths to 2 unaligned BAMs.


### Run it locally with the Dockstore CLI

```
dockstore tool launch --entry quay.io/pancancer/pcawg-bwa-mem-workflow:2.6.8-cwl1 --json sample_input.json 
```
